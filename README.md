# Amazon-Bestselling-Books-Analysis-with-Python

In this article, I’m going to introduce you to a data science project on Amazon bestselling books analysis with the Python programming language. The data I’ll be using in this data science project is a dataset of Amazon’s 50 Best Books between 2009 and 2019.

The dataset contains 550 books and has been categorized into fiction and non-fiction using Goodreads.
